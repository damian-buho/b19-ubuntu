# Run-once initialization (bootstrap.d)

- One-time setup tasks (database migrations, admin user creation, directory init) run on first container start only.
- Automatic idempotency: completed scripts are never re-run, even across container restarts.
- Failed scripts are retried on next start; successful ones stay locked.
- State can be reset by clearing a volume, triggering a full re-bootstrap.
- Downstream images add their own init scripts by dropping them into a directory.
