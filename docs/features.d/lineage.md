# Image lineage tracking

- Every image records its build metadata (namespace, project, version, base image) into a lineage file during build.
- Downstream images chain lineage from their parent, producing a full base-to-current provenance chain.
- At container startup, the full lineage chain is logged, making it easy to trace what a running container was built from.
