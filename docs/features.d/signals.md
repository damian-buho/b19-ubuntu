# Graceful signal handling

- PID 1 is `tini -g`, which reaps zombie processes and forwards signals to the full process group.
- A configurable set of Unix signals (TERM, INT, HUP, USR1, USR2, etc.) is trapped and forwarded to the main service process.
- `docker stop` cleanly terminates the service without orphan processes or signal loss.
