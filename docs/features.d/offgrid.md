# Air-gapped / offline build and runtime support

- A single environment variable (`B19_OFFGRID_MODE=Y`) cuts all internet access at build time and runtime.
- Build-time: downloads are blocked, APT updates are skipped, SSH keyscans are skipped. All artifacts must come from cache tiers.
- Runtime: network healthchecks automatically skip with a healthy result, so containers stay green on isolated networks.
- APT package lists can be snapshotted and injected for fully offline image builds.
- LAN services (caching proxies, registries) remain reachable — offgrid blocks internet, not all networking.
